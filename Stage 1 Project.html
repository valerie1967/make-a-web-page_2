    <h3 class="headersm">HTML</h3>
     <br>
    <p><b>HTML</b>, which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, creates the <em>look</em> of the text and other parts of web pages through the use of elements which are created with tags. Here is a
      link to a website that has a great tutorial on<a href="http://www.html-5-tutorial.com"> HTML 5</a>.
    </p>
     <h3 class="headersm">TAGS</h3>
      <p>      
       Tags can be closed or not, this means that the Text or URL reference is surrounded by a greater than sign a
       letter or group of letters denoting the type of element then a less than sign and then the text and then the close to the 
       element which consists of a greater than sign, a slash and the same letter or group of letters and another less than sign.<br>Example:<span class="example">&lt;p&gt;</span>
      </p>
     <h3 class="headersm">Elements</h3>
      <p>Elements come in two flavors either inline or Block, the difference being the Block elements
        encase the text or what have you in a box, while the inline elements do not.

   <h2 class="header">Lesson 2 Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="headersm">CSS: A First Look</h3>
     <p>CSS can define elements on the HTML page changing things like font size and color. This is done to avoid repetition. It is easier to define a style for an element and apply is to all like elements, thanks to 
       individually apply it to each DIV or H1 Tag. 
     </p>
    <h3 class="headersm">Boxes, Boxes and More Boxes</h3>
     <p>
       All parts of a web page are in boxes.Even the ones that seem <b>NOT</b> box-like or rectangularly shaped are in boxes. 
       Boxes are easily re-arranged on web pages.
     </p>
    <h3 class="headersm">Tree-like Structure</h3>
     <p>
       Element of HTML can be nested inside one another creating a <b>Tree-like Structure</b>. This type of structure is defined by a parent child relationsip between
       Tag elements where a Child element will be within it's parent counter-part. 
     </p>
    <h3 class="headersm">Text Editors</h3>
     <p>There are many types of text editors that developers use when creating the code for HTML web pages.
        Scratchpad, Codepen and Sublime are only three of them. They have varying degrees of ease of use, the ability to share and the languages they can accommodate.
        For example, ScratchPad is easy to use but can't be shared, Codepen can be shared but you need an account.
        Sublime can be used with HTML, CSS and Java but is not beginner friendly.

   <h2 class="header">Lesson 3 CSS Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
    <br>
   <h3 class="headersm">CSS: A Deeper Look</h3>
    <p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets
	     Control the way the elements look in HTML. Here is a link to a website that has a great tutorial on<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp"> CSS</a>.
        CSS can be written for a specific element or for a "class". It can be specified on the html document, either in the Header
	     or inline with the element. It can also be specified in a separate CSS document and linked or referred to 
	     in the HTML with the link tag.<br>
	     The syntax would be as follows:
    </p>
      <br>
    <div class="example">Element, curly brace, property: value; curly brace<br>
     <br>
        Example:<br> p &#123; <br>
                  color: green;<br>
                   &#125;<br>
     <br>
        For a Class<br>
     <br>
        Example:<br> &#60; div class="nameofclass"&#62; &#60;/div&#62;
     <br>
           &#60;style&#62;<br>
           .nameofclass &#123;<br>
           color: green;<br>
           &#125;<br>
           &#60;/style&#62;<br>
     <br>
        To link an CSS file with an HTML file<br>
     <br>
        Example:<br> In the Head Element<br>
        &#60;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="nameofcssfile.css"&#62;
     <br>
   </div>
    <p>An advantage of using CSS is the <b>avoidance of repetition</b>. You can define the look of specific elements once and apply the defined aspects to all like 
       parts once. If they don’t look right then you only have to troubleshoot the smaller CSS definition and not an entire HTML document.
